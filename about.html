		<p>Here at Math Quiz we take pride in teaching primarily 8th grade students through our quiz and usage of free math textbooks online. We are based out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin and many of our employees have had experience in teaching mathematics for over ten years. Students of all different backgrounds around the world will find this site useful. It is our goal to not only improve the knowledge in mathematics of everyone that uses our resources, but the mental ability. We do this through creating a timed atmosphere in our quiz and prohibiting the use of calculators.<br>
